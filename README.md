## Install
- download from the latest [release](https://github.com/superiums/lumesh/releases)
- compile from source :
```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/superiums/lumesh.git'
cargo build -r
```
_Currently, since in its early stages of development, I would recommend against using releases at the moment.
There are a lot of bug fixes and new features added in between releases._

#### After Install

```bash
# Just run the lumesh executable!
lumesh
```
